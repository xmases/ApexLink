    <h1>üìò Privacy & Legal Terms ‚Äì ApexLink</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        ApexLink is committed to offering a privacy-first service. We act as intermediaries for anonymous purchases using cryptocurrencies. By using our platform, you agree to the terms described here.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect names, documents, or identifying personal information. The only data stored includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Product link</li>
          <li>Order hash</li>
          <li>Delivery location (if provided)</li>
          <li>Email for order notifications</li>
        </ul>
        All data is stored encrypted and temporarily.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Payment and Crypto</h2>
      <p>
        All payments are made via Solana or Monero, depending on user preference. We do not store wallet private keys, only receive addresses. Payment links are generated per order hash and are never sent by email.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        ApexLink acts as an intermediary service. We are not the product seller, and therefore:
        <ul>
          <li>We are not liable for delays or quality of third-party products.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right to reject any order due to logistical concerns.</li>
          <li>We cannot provide guarantees once a product has been delivered to the indicated address or pickup point.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Use At Your Own Risk</h2>
      <p>
        By using ApexLink, you accept that you do so voluntarily and at your own risk. We operate in jurisdictions that allow privacy-focused operations, but users are responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Abuse Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Any attempt to use ApexLink for illegal, fraudulent, or harmful purposes will result in a permanent ban. We reserve the right to deny service without prior notice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Official Communications</h2>
      <p>
        We will only contact users via the following email:
        <ul>
		<li>aplinkhelp@proton.me</li>
        </ul>
        Any other emails are likely scams. Never trust payment addresses sent outside of our domain.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        All disputes or legal claims arising from the use of ApexLink shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain. By using this platform, users agree to resolve any issues under Spain jurisdiction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>9. Refunds and Support</h2>
      <p>
        Users have 1 week to complete the payment once an order is accepted. In case a product cannot be shipped after acceptance, we will contact the user via email and offer a full refund (including the flat-fee commission). Address or pickup point changes can be requested only through the official support email. Refunds depend on internal criteria and are not guaranteed; if accepted, the customer will cover return shipping up to ‚Ç¨7.50.
        Support will respond within 1 business day. If a support delay causes an unresolved issue, compensatory measures may be considered.
      </p>
